    "question": "What distinguishes closed-end mutual funds from open-end mutual funds in terms of unit pricing?",
    "options": [
      "Closed-end funds' unit prices are determined by market forces and may deviate from NAVPU, while open-end funds' unit prices always reflect NAVPU.",
      "Closed-end funds' unit prices are fixed at the IPO price, while open-end funds' unit prices fluctuate daily based on NAVPU.",
